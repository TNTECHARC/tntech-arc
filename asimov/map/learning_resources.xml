  The purpose of this document is to provide a starting point for anyone interested in contributing
  to the design and implementation of the Mapping module for Hawking. Here you can find some useful
  resources that I am using to learn about how mapping is generally done in robotics applications
  by major researchers in the field. Feel free to add some resources you find helpful, but please
  stick to the following format.

  Note that the `type' attribute of `resource_type' is generally going to be the documents file extension
  For example, if the resource_type is a webpage, you would write:
    <webpage type="html"> or <webpage type="php"> or etc.

  Also, note that the `type' attribute of `resource_location' is generally going to be where you found the
  document.
  For example, if the resource_location is the library, you would write:
    <resource_location type="ttu_library"> or <resource_location type="putnam_county_public_library"> or etc.

    <description>
      A book that attempts to teach SLAM methods (in a very special case, but it seems like it could be extended to other cases)
      using a tutorial-style approach. It would seem there are various code examples, which it doesn't need to be stated that
      that is a useful thing.
